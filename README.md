# Spyfish Aotearoa Toolkit
This repository contains the scripts and information required to manage the footage and metadata of Spyfish Aotearoa, a collaboration between [Wildlife.ai](https://wildlife.ai/) and [Te Papa Atawhai](https://www.doc.govt.nz/about-us/) to monitor Marine Reserves across Aotearoa using Baited Underwater Videos.

## Overview
Spyfish Aotearoa utilises a citizen science and machine learning approach to classify baited underwater video (BUV) footage collected from New Zealand marine reserves. This project has a modular architecture featuring custom-built applications and software.

## sftk

The Spyfish Aotearoa Toolkit (sftk) is a Python package that provides a set of tools to manage the data pipeline and management of the Spyfish Aotearoa project.

### Usage

You can install the package by running this

```
pip install "/path/to/Spyfish-Aotearoa-toolkit"
```
or with the dev tag, which adds a few additional development related libraries (the -e stands for editable, meaning that if you change something in the code it will be reflected in the functioning in the package).
```
pip install -e "/path/to/Spyfish-Aotearoa-toolkit[dev]"
```


You can also use the sftk package by adding the root directory to your `PYTHONPATH` and importing the modules you need.

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('path/to/Spyfish-Aotearoa-toolkit')
from sftk import ...
```

Alternatively you can add to `PYTHONPATH` through your Terminal:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/Spyfish-Aotearoa-toolkit
```

Or add this line to `.bashrc` to make it permanent:

```bash
echo 'export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/Spyfish-Aotearoa-toolkit' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Collaborations

We are working to make our work available to anyone interested.
Take a look into existing [issues][issues-url] (or code), and contribute any way you can.



Feel free to [contact us][contact_info], if you have any questions.



### Pre-Commit checks

We set up some pre-commit checks, so run this before you contribute:
```bash
pip install pre-commit # only the first time
pre-commit install
```

This will fix/change/flag any issues defined in our pre-commit config.
You need to re add any changes performed by the pre-commit.


Make sure your code is up to standard, but if the existing code is showing too many errors, feel free to skip it by adding `--no-verify`:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
```

You can run single commands, for example:
```bash
pre-commit run flake8
```


### Spelling checker
Please install a spelling checker in your IDE of choice, for example [this one][spell-checker] VS code/Cursor.
